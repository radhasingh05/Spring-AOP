The @SpringBootApplication annotation contains the @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation.

The auto configuration uses @Conditional type annotations (like @ConditionalOnClass and @ConditionalOnProperty) to scan the classpath and look for key classes that trigger the loading of 'modules' like AOP

User can control the type of proxy , JDK proxy or CGLIB style
to chose CGLIB @EnableAutoConfiguration(proxyTargetClass=true)
